Operating System -- a key software that manages all hardware and software on a computer. It controls system resources, manages files, organizes running programs, provides security, and offers user interface for interaction. Examples include Windows, macOS, Linus, and Android

Linux -- a free and open-source OS that is based on Unix. A popular choice for servers, embedded devices, and personal computers. Linux is open-source, highly customizable, reliable and secure, and has a large community of users and developers.

Unix -- A powerful, multi-user, and multitasking operating system developed in the 1960s at AT&T Bell Labs. Known for its modular design, promoting the philosophy 'Do one thing and do it well.' It's the basis for many modern OSes, including Linux and BSD. Used widely in servers, workstations, and mainframes with numerous commercial and open-source variants

Windows -- Windows is a graphical operating system developed by Microsoft. It manages hardware and software resources, supports a vast range of applications, and allows users to interact with the computer via windows, icons, and menus rather than typing commands.

kernel -- The kernel is the core component of an operating system. It manages system resources, and communication between hardware and software components. Functions include device management, memory management, and process managementa program that manages the resources of a computer. It allows software to interact with hardware, and it controls how system resources are used to meet the needs of the programs running on the system.

Central Processing Unit- The brain of a computer. It is responsible for carrying out the instructions of a computer program. It processes instructions, performs calculations, and manages data. It interacts with all other hardware components in the system to execute the operating system and applications.

primary memory(RAM) -- Is the computer's working memory. It temporarily stores data that the CPU needs immediate access to while running programs. Its contents can be quickly changed and are lost when the computer is powered off.

secondary memory(persistant) -- Slower large permanent stoarge - lasts until deleted - disk drive/memory stick

Shell -- a user interface for access to an operating system's services. It can be either a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical interface (GUI). In a shell, users can execute commands, run scripts, or use applications to interact with the system. Common examples of shells include Bash, Zsh, and the Windows Command Prompt.

Bash -- a popular shell in Unix and Linux systems. It is an improved version of the Bourne Shell (sh), offering advanced features like command line editing, command history, and command completion. Bash is commonly used for executing commands and scripting.
