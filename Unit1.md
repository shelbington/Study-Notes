GitHub -- a web-based hosting service and platform for version control using Git. It provides a centralized location for hosting Git repositories and offers additional collaboration and project management features.

Git -- Git is a distributed version control system. This means that every copy of the repository is a full copy of the project, with all of its history. This makes it easy to work on projects collaboratively, as everyone can have their own copy of the repository and make changes without affecting anyone else.

.gitignore -- a text file used in Git repositories to specify files and directories that should be ignored and not tracked by Git.

machine code -- a low-level programming language that is directly understood and executed by a computer's hardware. It consists of instructions written in a binary format that represents specific operations and data manipulations.

binary -- In computers and digital systems, binary is the fundamental representation of data. It is used to represent instructions, numbers, characters, and other information. Inside a computer's electronic circuitry, data is stored and processed using electrical states that can be interpreted as 0s and 1s.

executable -- The executable file is a binary file that the computer's operating system understands and can execute. It contains the machine code instructions specific to the computer's architecture, as well as any necessary data or resources.

program -- a set of instructions that tells a computer how to perform specific tasks or operations. It is a sequence of instructions written in a programming language that can be executed by a computer or interpreted by an interpreter.

compiled vs interpreted programming languages --

Compiled programming languages translate the source code into machine code before execution. This produces an executable file that can be directly executed by the computer's operating system. Compiled languages generally offer faster execution since the code is already translated into machine code. Examples include C, C++, Go, and Rust.

On the other hand, interpreted programming languages execute the source code directly without explicit compilation. An interpreter reads and processes the code line by line or statement by statement during runtime. Interpreted languages are often platform-independent and provide flexibility as the interpreter executes the code in a specific environment. However, interpreted languages may have slower execution compared to compiled languages. Examples include Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP.

command line -- text-based interface in which you can interact with a computer's operating system by entering commands. It allows you to perform various tasks, execute programs, and control the system by typing commands and receiving text-based output.

PATH -- an environment variable in operating systems that specifies a set of directories where executable programs are located. When you execute a command in the command line or terminal, the operating system searches for the corresponding executable file in the directories listed in the PATH variable.

zsh -- short for "Z Shell," is an alternative command-line shell to the more commonly used Bash shell in Unix-like operating systems. It is designed to be an interactive shell with advanced features, improved user experience, and enhanced scripting capabilities.

Node.js -- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

package management system -- A package management system is a tool that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages (libraries, frameworks, tools, etc.) in a consistent manner.Examples of package managers include npm for Node.js, pip for Python, apt for Ubuntu, and yum for Fedora and CentOS, among many others.

Homebrew -- a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on Apple's macOS operating system and Linux. It's designed to make it easier to install a wide range of software and to handle any dependencies the software might have.

command line flags -- parameters that are passed to a command-line program. They modify the behavior of the program. Flags usually follow the main command and start with a hyphen ("-") or double hyphen ("--").

html -- the standard language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and, originally, included cues for the appearance of the document.

css -- controls the visual appearance of the web page elements, including layout, color, fonts, spacing, and much more.

function declaration -- defines a function with the specified parameters. It begins with the "function" keyword. It has the advantage of being hoisted, meaning it can be used before it's defined in your code.

function example() {}

function expression -- a way to define a function as part of a variable assignment expression. Function expressions are not hoisted, which means that you can't call the function before you define it in your code.let

let example = function() {}
