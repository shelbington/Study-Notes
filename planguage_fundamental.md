dynamically-typed language: In dynamically-typed languages, the type is checked on the fly as the code is executed. This means you don't have to explicitly declare the variable types - they can change as needed during execution. Examples of dynamically-typed languages are JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. The advantage here is flexibility and ease of use, especially for small scripts or for beginners. The downside is that type errors can be caught late in the development cycle, and these languages can be less efficient at runtime because they have to check types while the code is running.

statically-typed language: In these languages, the type checking happens at compile time, meaning before the code is actually run. This requires you to explicitly declare the variable types, and once a variable's type is set, it usually can't be changed. Examples of statically-typed languages are C++, Java, and Rust. The advantage of static typing is that type errors are caught early in the development cycle, and these languages can also be more efficient at runtime because they know the exact data types ahead of time. The drawback is a less flexible language with potentially more up-front work.
