dynamically-typed language:

In dynamically-typed languages, the type is checked on the fly as the code is executed. This means you don't have to explicitly declare the variable types - they can change as needed during execution. Examples of dynamically-typed languages are JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. The advantage here is flexibility and ease of use, especially for small scripts or for beginners. The downside is that type errors can be caught late in the development cycle, and these languages can be less efficient at runtime because they have to check types while the code is running.

statically-typed language:

In these languages, the type checking happens at compile time, meaning before the code is actually run. This requires you to explicitly declare the variable types, and once a variable's type is set, it usually can't be changed. Examples of statically-typed languages are C++, Java, and Rust. The advantage of static typing is that type errors are caught early in the development cycle, and these languages can also be more efficient at runtime because they know the exact data types ahead of time. The drawback is a less flexible language with potentially more up-front work.

Semantic HTML:

the use of HTML markup to reinforce the meaning or semantics of the information in webpages rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Semantic HTML elements are those elements that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way.

Examples of semantic HTML elements include:

<header>, <footer>, <nav>, <main>, and <section> for page structure.
<article>, <aside>, and <details> for content.
<figure>, <figcaption> for images.
<time>, <mark>, and <summary> for inline text enhancements.

Function vs Method:

A method is essentially a function, but it's associated with an object or a class. It's defined within a class and is typically used to perform operations that are relevant to that class. Methods are invoked on specific instances of an object and they can access data contained within that instance.

Function Declaration vs Function Expression:

The main difference, beyond syntax, is that function expresssion are not hoisted and function declarations are. You can't use function expressions before you create them.

Frontend Development:

The process of creating the user interface (UI) of a website or web application. This includes the layout, design, and functionality of the elements that users see and interact with, such as text, images, buttons, and forms. Frontend developers use programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the UI.

Backend Development:

The process of creating the server-side logic of a website or web application. This includes the code that handles data storage, retrieval, and processing. Backend developers use programming languages such as Python, Java, and PHP to create the backend logic.

Key differences between frontend and backend development:

Focus: Frontend development focuses on the user interface, design, and client-side interactions, while backend development focuses on the server-side logic and infrastructure.
Technologies: Frontend development primarily involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while backend development involves a broader range of programming languages and frameworks.
User Interaction: Frontend development handles user interactions and provides a visual interface, while backend development handles data processing, storage, and communication between the frontend and the server.
Execution Environment: Frontend code runs in the user's web browser, while backend code runs on the server.

Block Scoping:

The concept of variables being scoped to the nearest enclosing block "{}", rather than being scoped to the entired function(like with "var")
